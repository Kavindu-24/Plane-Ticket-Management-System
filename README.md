In the above picture, can notice four rows of seats labelled as A, B, C and D, and it is important to note that these rows have varying seat capacities (either 12 or 14 seats). Seats are coded according to their row and seat number and have different prices according to their colour. For example, the seat marked with an ‘X’ is considered seat B2 and costs £200.
